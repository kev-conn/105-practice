                <h4>What is Advice?</h4>
                <h5>Advice: guidance or recommendations offered with regard to prudent future action.</h5>
                <p>Sometimes when people ask me for advice I give them blunt honest answers, some appreciate and some don't. I know that my personality can be more logical than empathetic, so I try to take a second before offering anything.</p>
 
                <p>When I started this program I decided that I was going to make a change in my life, grab a hold of my career, my finances and my future, not only mine but my families.</p>

                <p>I recommend jumping in with both feet, never looking back and always looking ahead. It's going to be tough at times, you may not fully grasp what's going on, but with time you will understand and you will excell at it.</p>
 
                <h4>Dig Deep</h4>
                <p>The only times I feel that are most difficult are the in between moments. Learning something new but not fully grasping it. I have to remind myself that I am going through this quicker than I thought, and I am better at this than I think I am.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>My best advice is to keep doing it, keep learning new things, keep training your brain to comprehend what's going on. Read a lot of code and keep learning!</p>
